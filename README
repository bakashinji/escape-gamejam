folderstructure:

checkout svn: https://svn.icg.tugraz.at/gamejam/escape/

cd escape
git clone git@github.com:bakashinji/escape-gamejam.git dev_files


mkdir build
cd ../build
ccmake ../dev_files
press c
ignore that boost lib dir couldn't be found, doesn't matter ^^
press g

execute the binary from the dev_files folder with: ../build/dist/bin/escape

to install ogrebullet with archlinux do the following:
copy the PKGBUILD file as well as the bugfix.diff in a seperate folder
run makepkg
run pacman -U <packagename>.tar.xz
you can now delete the whole stuff in this dir
